If you want to remake/fix/make a better one (cause im absolutly not good at coding) i will have some simple scratch code documentation. such as how json files are structured or how other stuff in scratch works.

## Json formating for scratch
there is a web page for this but ill go a litle more detailed with absolutly everything ive found.

the scratch sb3 file is just a fancy zip file. And beneath that is a json file with everything in it, Ill try explain every property of the scratch json files.

first of all there are three main objects. `"targets"`, `"monitors"` and `"extentions"`

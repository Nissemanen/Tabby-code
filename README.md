# For Others
If you want to remake/fix/make a better one (cause im absolutly not good at coding) i will have some simple scratch code documentation. such as how json files are structured or how other stuff in scratch works.

## Json formating for scratch
there is a web page for this but ill go a litle more detailed with absolutly everything ive found.

the scratch sb3 file is just a fancy zip file. And beneath that is a json file with everything in it, Ill try explain every property of the scratch json files.

first of all there are four main objects. `"targets"`, `"monitors"`, `"extentions"` and `"meta"`

its in `"targets"` where all the sprites and their data is stored.\n
in `"monitors"` you find all the monitors with their positions and values.\n
in `"extentions"` is where all the extentions are, such as the pen extention.\n
in `"meta"` is all the metadata that the project has, this is usualy not tamperd with.\n

### targets
every target has some core components, these are:

`isStage`  kind of self explainitory
